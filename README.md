# Research_Tools

The purpose of FDA Research Science Tools (RSTs), developed by the FDA-CDRH's Office of Science and Engineering Labs (OSEL), is to assist in the development of new medical technologies.  

Initially, <b>Research_Tools</b> analyzes the 117 RSTs offered by FDA-OSEL in three manners: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1\. The availability of RSTs by industry type. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2\. The availability of RSTs by tool type (i.e. Laboratory Method, etc.). <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3\. How RST tool types serve various areas of research. <br>
>The data for these analyses are extracted from the [Catalog of Regulatory Science Tools to Help Assess New Medical Devices](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/science-and-research-medical-devices/catalog-regulatory-science-tools-help-assess-new-medical-devices).
>Area-of-research is automatically reduced to base disciplines (Neurology Oncology -> Neurology) by root words.  

<p><br>Next, open-source industry data is integrated to offer three additional analyses: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Interactions between RST parameters and industry size. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Interactions between RST parameters and industry growth. <br>
