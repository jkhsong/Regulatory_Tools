# Research_Tools

The purpose of FDA Research Science Tools (RSTs), developed by the FDA-CDRH's Office of Science and Engineering Labs (OSEL), is to assist in the development of new medical technologies.  

Initially, <b>Research_Tools</b> analyzes the 117 RSTs offered by FDA-OSEL in three manners: 
1. The availability of RSTs by industry type.
2. The availability of RSTs by tool type (i.e. Laboratory Method, etc.).
3. How RST tool types serve various areas of research.
The data for these analyses are extracted from the [Catalog of Regulatory Science Tools to Help Assess New Medical Devices](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/science-and-research-medical-devices/catalog-regulatory-science-tools-help-assess-new-medical-devices).

Next, open-source industry data is integrated to offer three additional analyses:
4. Interactions between RST parameters and industry size
5. Interactions between RST parameters and industry growth.
